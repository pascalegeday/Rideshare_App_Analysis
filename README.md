# Rideshare App "Pyber" Analysis
In this project, I was tasked with assisting data analyst at Pyber by producing analysis and visualizations of Pyber data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO of Pyber. Thus, giving insight on way in which Pyber can improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for under-served neighborhoods. 

# Resources
* Data Source: Pyber_ride_data.csv & city-data.csv & ride_data.csv
* Software: Python 3.8.9, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6
* Tools: Matplotlib Library

# Results
Key components of this project were to create a ride-sharing summary by city type and a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type (see below). 
By analyzing these components, among many, we can make business recommendations to the Pyber CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 

## Pyber Summary By City Type

# Summary
* Rural cities have the least rides(125) and number of drivers (78) among the three city types. However, the average fare per ride($34.62) and the average fare per driver($55.49) is significantly higher than suburban and urban cities. This may be due to the fact that riders in rural cities need to travel farther distances, hence, the increase in fare. Another notable finding is that due to there being a small number drivers, there is less access to rides in rural cities so they are not creating as much revenue. Also, when rides do take place, they come at a significantly more expensive fare rate. This could prevent future riders, as some may not be willing to pay higher fares. 
Business recommendations:
1. Increase the number of drivers in rural cities. If there are more drivers, riders will have increased access to Pyber and the total fares may increase. 

Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
