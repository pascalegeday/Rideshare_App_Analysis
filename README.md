# Rideshare App "Pyber" Analysis Using Python/Jupyter/Matplotlib Library
In this project, I was tasked with assisting data analyst at Pyber by producing analysis and visualizations of Pyber data from January to early May of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO of Pyber. Thus, giving insight on way in which Pyber can improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for under-served neighborhoods. 

# Resources
Data Source: Pyber_ride_data.csv & city-data.csv & ride_data.csv
Software: Python 3.8.9, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.6

# Results
Key components of this project were to create a ride-sharing summary by city type and a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type (see below). 
By analyzing these components, among many, we can make business recommendations to the Pyber CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
